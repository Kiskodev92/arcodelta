# Adding AOS (Animate On Scroll) for Animations
AOS (Animate On Scroll) is a lightweight JavaScript library that allows you to add animation effects as you scroll through your page. Below are the steps to install and use AOS in your React project.

## Installation
To install AOS, you need to add it as a dependency using npm:
```bash
npm install aos
```
Or if you prefer using yarn:
```bash
yarn add aos
```

# Usage in a React Project

1. Import AOS and its CSS:
In the component where you want to use AOS, usually your main component (e.g., App.jsx or Home.jsx), import the library and its styles:

```bash
import React, { useEffect } from 'react';
import AOS from 'aos';
import 'aos/dist/aos.css';
```

2. Initialize AOS:
Inside your component, use the `useEffect` hook to initialize AOS:

```bash
useEffect(() => {
  AOS.init({
    duration: 1000, // Animation duration in milliseconds
    once: true, // Whether the animation should happen only once
  });
}, []);
```
There are various animations you can apply, such as:

*fade-up
*fade-down
*fade-left
*fade-right
*zoom-in
*zoom-out
For a full list of available animations, check the AOS documentation.
